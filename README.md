# Snapchat_Filter

### Author : Ankit Gupta

Description: A Snapchat-like application based on the standard pipeline of 1) Face Detection using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptor, 2) Facial Landmark Estimation using Kazemi-Sullivan and finally, 3) adding overlays/lenses (like funny glasses, etc) to the frames using the previously estimated landmarks.

Python code in form of a Jupyter Notebook can be viewed [here](https://github.com/ag1988/Snapchat_Filter/blob/master/Face_Detection_using_HOG.ipynb).
