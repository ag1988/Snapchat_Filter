# Snapchat_filter_using_HOG

Author : Ankit Gupta

Description: We build a Snapchat-like application based on the standard pipeline of 1) Face Detection using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) descriptor, 2) Facial Landmark Estimation using Kazemi-Sullivan and finally, 3) adding overlays/lenses (like funny glasses, etc) to the frames using the previously estimated landmarks.
